### Changed
- The client now scans for keys each tick rather than listening for key presses and releases
- Manual print statements have been replaced with Logger.log statements
- IDs are now assigned to every entity

### Changed
- Minimap now updates immediately once a tile is changed
- MapLink has been generalized to ActiveTile

### Changed
- Turned InventoryBar into a GUIContainer
	- InventoryBar now holds ten InventoryEntries
	- Replicates previous behavior, but differently

### Added
- Addition of rudimentary AI system
	- Added MobAction abstract class and MoveAction and IdleAction classes
	- Added MobRoutine abstract class and IdleRoutine and FleeRoutine
		- Within each entity class's update() method, the current scenario is evaluated whenever the Mob's think() method is called
		- The think() method determines which routine will be used, and the routine assembles a (possibly random) order of actions
		- The mob then moves according to the mob's current routine's current action
	- Added AI for chicken; idles until the player is within 5 blocks, then runs away from the player until 5+ blocks away

### Changed

	- A further distortion distribution map can limit the range of the distortion map
- Spawn area now guaranteed to be on land and not generate in the middle of a lake
- Console can now be opened by holding CTRL+F and then pressing P (even when not in debug mode)

### Notes
- NEW NUMBERING SYSTEM:
	- majorelease.update.bugfix_checkpoint
	- This was necessary due to the size of the next update.
	- The checkpoint is to ensure I don't break the code and not know how to fix it.

## [0.10.0] - 2016-12-24 (The Efficiency Update)

### Added
- Added Huffman compression for map saves
	- Created a new utility library
	- Added a modified Huffman compressor (from CIS 121) to utility library
	- Added a binary reader and writer from Princeton's standard library to utility library. This was necessary to write single bits to file
	- Huffman might not be necessary; generating the encoding map takes the vast majority of time. It might be a better idea to use predetermined values for common tiles

### Changed
- Reimplemented minimap more efficiently
	- Only one zoom level of minimap
	- Minimap is now generated after initialization of map
	- Minimap is cropped accordingly on draw
	- Drawback: must re-render minimap every time the map changes, must be done manually

- Removed posX and posY variables from entities, they are now contained within its "bounds" object
- The player now uses a "fake" position to determine tile collisions (its actual position +0.5 on each axis, but will use its actual position to determine collision with objects and entities. This will get confusing; look for solution

- Work begun on a minimap

### Changed
- MapLoader renamed Loader, and has been fixed

- Created something of a 2D rendering system
	- Renders a grid which is randomly generated of three different types of tiles: dirt, grass, rock
	- Always renders with the GameCenter in the center of the screen
	- Window is resizable, so that only the blocks that would fit on the screen at any time are rendered.
- Four different types of coordinates:
	- GameCenter: the exact position (a decimal double) of the cursor
	- GameCenterBlock: the block that the cursor is currently on
	- DisplayCenter: the center of the QuestPanel relative to top-left (in terms of pixels)
	- DisplayBlockDimensions: the dimensions of the QuestPanel (in terms of tiles)
- A timer goes off every 5ms:
	- Redraws the panel based on the current coordinates and dimensions
	- Checks what arrow keys are pressed down, moving the cursor appropriately
- Whenever an arrow key is pressed, it is added to an array of keys. Whenever released, it is removed.
- Status panel in upper-left corner displays all four coordinates
