0.1.0 - 2/2/16
-Created something of a 2D rendering system
--Renders a grid which is randomly generated of three different types of tiles: dirt, grass, rock
--Always renders with the GameCenter in the center of the screen
--Window is resizable, so that only the blocks that would fit on the screen at any time are rendered.
-Four different types of coordinates:
--GameCenter: the exact position (a decimal double) of the cursor
--GameCenterBlock: the block that the cursor is currently on
--DisplayCenter: the center of the QuestPanel relative to top-left (in terms of pixels)
--DisplayBlockDimensions: the dimensions of the QuestPanel (in terms of tiles)
-A timer goes off every 5ms:
--Redraws the panel based on the current coordinates and dimensions
--Checks what arrow keys are pressed down, moving the cursor appropriately
-Whenever an arrow key is pressed, it is added to an array of keys. Whenever released, it is removed.
-Status panel in upper-left corner displays all four coordinates
