0.1.0 - 2/2/16
-Created something of a 2D rendering system
--Renders a grid which is randomly generated of three different types of tiles: dirt, grass, rock
--Always renders with the GameCenter in the center of the screen
--Window is resizable, so that only the blocks that would fit on the screen at any time are rendered.
-Four different types of coordinates:
--GameCenter: the exact position (a decimal double) of the cursor
--GameCenterBlock: the block that the cursor is currently on
--DisplayCenter: the center of the QuestPanel relative to top-left (in terms of pixels)
--DisplayBlockDimensions: the dimensions of the QuestPanel (in terms of tiles)
-A timer goes off every 5ms:
--Redraws the panel based on the current coordinates and dimensions
--Checks what arrow keys are pressed down, moving the cursor appropriately
-Whenever an arrow key is pressed, it is added to an array of keys. Whenever released, it is removed.
-Status panel in upper-left corner displays all four coordinates

0.2.0 - 2/5/16
-Split up the game's logic and its display into separate components (questPanel --> questGame + questPanel)
-Split the GamePanel rendering into several different methods:
--drawBoard(g)
--drawStatus(g)
--drawCursor(g)
-Optimized drawBoard(g) to use temporary variables instead of reiterating through computations for each tile
-Removed the black edges from each tile
-The cursor can no longer enter stone or null tiles
-The movement-per-tick of the cursor is now constrained to a variable "speed" in questGame
-Movement of the curson in each direction is now constrained to a method "attemptMove()"

0.3.0 - 2/8/16
-Created procedurally generated "character" sprite (placeholder) that looks like an arrow
-Created a new class "StatusBar", customizable with color, max value, and of course, scale
-Added two StatusBars, one for "mana" and one for "health"
-Added four new blocks, one which increases speed, one which increases mana, one that increases health, one that drains all three
-Added a new method in QuestGame to react to the block the player is currently on
